"""The reminder sent to accounts that registered but never finished setting up.

One definition, three consumers: the admin console's one-click button, the
`tools/notify_stalled.py` CLI, and the tests. They must agree, because the thing
being decided is *which sentence a person needs* -- and sending the wrong one is
worse than sending nothing: telling somebody who already configured a mailbox to
"go turn on IMAP" reads as "everything you did was pointless".

Four groups
-----------
* ``never``   -- no usable mailbox at all. They need to know the four steps exist
  and are short.
* ``refused`` -- a mailbox is configured but the mail server keeps rejecting it.
  They need to know that 授权码 is not their mailbox login password.
* ``provider`` -- the mailbox's provider stopped accepting app passwords
  altogether (Microsoft consumer accounts, 2026-09-16). No credential can fix
  this; the letter has to say so, or the person spends an evening generating
  authorisation codes that cannot work.
* ``no_mail`` -- the mailbox connects perfectly and nothing has ever arrived
  (added 2026-09-16). They need to know that the school side of the chain is the
  one nobody has proved: **forwarding cannot be tested from here, and the only
  evidence it exists is that a message actually arrived.** This is the third
  face of the same failure mode, and it was the last one still silent -- a
  fully-configured account that receives nothing forever looks, from the
  console, exactly like an account that is merely new.

The provider-specific steps are read from :mod:`pilot_app.mailpresets`, the same
source the in-app wizard renders, so this mail cannot drift from the product. A
reminder that sends someone to a menu that no longer exists is a support ticket.
The ``no_mail`` letter instead renders the *school* side (CityU's own published
forwarding steps, see :func:`_school_forward_steps`) -- the private-mailbox
steps are the ones that account has already finished.

Why this is not just the sentinel
---------------------------------
`setup_gap` already makes a stalled account *visible to the operator*, and the
sentinel already reports `setup_stalled`. Visible is not fixed: **the one person
who cannot see the problem is the person it belongs to.** They receive nothing,
nothing fails, and nothing tells them anything was expected of them.

Sending is deliberately awkward
-------------------------------
* **Never twice by accident.** Each delivery is recorded in `app_settings` under
  ``setup_reminder:<user_id>``; a second run skips anyone already written to.
* **Written after the send, not before.** The other order would mark somebody as
  told when the send had actually failed -- the one way to lose a person.
* **A brand-new account is left alone** (see :data:`MIN_AGE_HOURS`): somebody who
  registered ten minutes ago is not stuck, they are busy.
